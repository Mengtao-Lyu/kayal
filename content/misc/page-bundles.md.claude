Kayal utilizes [Page bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) to efficiently serve page resources such as images, videos, and audio files.

## Folder Structure

To add assets like images (including cover images), videos, or audio files to a page, Kayal expects them to be served as [Page Resources](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/). Here's a guide on how to organize your content:

1. Create a directory with the same name as your article.
2. Inside this directory, create an `index.md` file with your content.
3. Place all assets used by the markdown file in this folder.

Your structure should look similar to this:

```
content
└── posts
    └── awesome-post
        ├── index.md
        ├── cover-image.jpg
        ├── img1.png
        ├── img2.png
        ├── video.mp4
        └── ...
```

## Referencing Assets

You can refer to these assets in your markdown using relative paths:

### Cover Image

To add a cover image, include this line in your markdown frontmatter:

```toml
coverImg: "cover-image.jpg"
```

### Including Images and Videos

To include images and videos in your content, use the following markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Image 1](img1.png)
![Image 2](img2.png)
![Video](video.mp4)
```
